<h1>The Best Movies According to Elaine</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How To Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite franshises. The love that the main character and his dragon shares is nothing short of emotional and spectacular. </p>
<h3>White Chicks</h3>
<p>Just a really funny, out of line movie that will have you gasping for breath. </p>
<h3>She's the Man</h3>
<p>Another comfort high school movie that is inspired by Shakesphere suprisingly. </p>
